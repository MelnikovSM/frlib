# MelnikovSM's FaceRecognizer Library
Example programs sources are included in dir: capturePositive.py gentemplate.py recogn.py
Main library file: frlib.py

Library (or, hope be honest, just case of functions) wroten by Melnikov Sergey, 14 full years after birth. Library wroten to simplificate my program for my project "Wonderful Creature Recognizer and Just Self-Wroten Song Player" (at the moment of library publication project not completed).

FR Lib - image library for Python, containing the basic functions needed for face recognition using OpenCV (just simplified OpenCV functions call, nothing more)..
The requirements for the operation: Python 2.7.X with a working module CV2 + Haar cascades (requires a file that was originally sought in the /usr/share/opencv/haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml, it can be corrected on the 15th line).
